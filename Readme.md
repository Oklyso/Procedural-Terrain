# GameJam 3
# Procedural Terrain


---------------------------------------------

## How to use:
### Open in unity, add a certain number of heights to a heightmap, set the heights and colors and watch terrain be generated.


## Had to re-create the git repo, because I messed up adding the function to switch between Noise-mode and Color-mode.
